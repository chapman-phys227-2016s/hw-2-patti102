# PHYS227 HW 2

**Author:** Taylor Patti

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-2-patti102.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-2-patti102)

**Due date:** 2016/02/16

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise 5.18 (```fit_pendulum_data.py```)
1. Exercise 5.22 (```midpoint_vec.py```)
1. Exercise 5.23 (```Lagrange_poly1.py```)
1. Exercise 5.24 (```Lagrange_poly2.py```)
1. Exercise 5.25 (```Lagrange_poly2b.py```)

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw2.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

The best part of this assignment was the Lagrangian Interpolant project. That actually made me think in a mathematical and physical way before I could even solve the problem. The worst part of the project was trying to fit the plotting required into the formats that the excercises specified. If we are able to better organize our programs and modules, should we feel free to do so?

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

As always, I looked up the meanings of my error messages and used the online python docs as well as the book instructions and code for the main template for my work.

Signed,

Taylor Patti
